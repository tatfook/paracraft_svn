TODO: design an official way to change default window theme.

2008.10.27:
	- TODO BUG lxz: the new click and click creation has a bug: create a grass model, right click and open its attribute panel, right click to cancel. the creation is no longer useful. 
		I think the old click once to create is also convient sometimes. I prefer using a checkbox to decide which method to use. May add some keyboard shotcut to scale and rotate the model while during move. 
	- TODO BUG lxz: when in offline mode, load a world and click homepage. It will pops up login window. after login, the BBS generate lots of errors
		GetBBS error on channel:Channel_Help, errorcode:500
		script/ide/TreeView.lua:404: attempt to index field 'TreeView' (a nil value) <Runtime error>

2008.10.10:
	- Character 
	- TODO lxz: Make character and scene creator panel draggable
	- TODO lxz: design a way to create windows by specifying right top or right bottom positions to the current screen area. 
	- TODO lxz: CCS should avoid using miniscenegraph. for each model, use miniscenegraph to generate several 64*64 dds texture in temp folder and reuse the texture the next time the model thumbnail is displayed. 
	- TODO lxz: when adding new objects to the scene via user interface, we should automatically add the mesh object to the zone where the camera eye position resides. 
	- TODO lxz: Inventory window (lib prepared). 
	- TODO lxz: friends map and star map graph viewer (lib prepared)
