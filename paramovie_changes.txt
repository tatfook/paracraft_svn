2008.2.21
	- multiple check out should be allowed in vss. 
	- TODO: when jabber logs out where another user kicks in, we should never auto reconnect. 
	- InstalledAppPage.html is implemented with dragging implemented with UI animation. 
	- TODO: div should support background2 attribute and attribute property. 
	- TODO: Treeview and pe:gridview should be able to remember its last scroll position. 

2008.2.19
	- wireshark is used to analyze the traffic a bit. 
	- The " is always translated to &quot; which costs lots of space in jabber/xml, so we shall avoid using it as lua content, [[]] is a better choice. or a CDATA is a better.
	- The NPL lua table will be serialized more compact by using key name, instead of ["key"], if key contains only alphabetic letters. 
	- Subversion is fully studied and planned to develop a 3d world coauthoring system for internal developers. TortoizeSVN is installed. 

2008.2.17
	- Terrain now tesselate according to max vertex error, which delivers much better result. 

2008.2.14
	- ParaAssetObject.GetAttributeObject() is implemented. ParaX and static mesh model asset now supports attributes like PolyCount and TextureUsage.
	- ObjectInspectorPage.html is implemented, which will report polycount and texture usages of asset in ObjectAddPage.html
	- pe:tabs now support TabPosition, which can specify where the tab buttons are placed. We can place the tabs on the bottom. 

2008.2.13
	- ide/FileViewCtrl.lua now support recursive folder content display. 
	
2008.2.12
	- skypage will now search disk files as well for new skyboxes. 
	- when terrain main texture is not found, the default one "Texture/tileset/generic/MainTexture1.dds" is used instead. 
	- _guihelper.AutoTrimTextByWidth is implemented. 
	- ide/FileViewCtrl.lua is fully implemented. It supports lazy rendering for file icons
	- pe:filebrowser now supports both TreeView and FileView styles. 

2008.2.8
	- .Net ResEditor is compiled. It can be used to edit .resources file.
	- ide/MainMenu now supports ItemStyle property set to "ButtonOnly".
	- pe:tabview now supports ItemStyle property which corresponds to ide/MainMenu's ItemStyle
	- ObjectsPage.html is implemented using pe:tabview with button tabs.

2008.2.3
	- Studying the FarCry2 editor:
		- editor settings: show fog, show shadows, show water, show collections, show headon display, enable sounds, show grid(grid resolution), keep objects with terrain, auto snap object, auto snap object rotation, camera stays above terrain, invert mouse view, inverse mouse pan, Engine quality(Optimal,)
		  overwrite object distance, viewport quality (100%)...
		- Bottom indicator: movement speed(2-64), position, ftp, etc.   
		- object:group selection, neighbourhood selection, move(local, global), Use gizmo, snap, add
		- collection system: vegetations
		- shadow system: interpolate(real-time shadow map + precomputed shadow). The shadow map itself is restricted to a limited region, so that the shadow quality can be guaranteed. 
			And the shadow paint is a seperate render pass that interpolate according to distance in a similar fashion as the fog.
		- bird: unlike buildings. such objects contains helper display object for object selection in editing mode. Such is the case with the light and camera object. 
		- the x file shold support exporting helper meshes that is only shown in editing mode, such as ladders, etc. 
		- occlussion volume is used for outdoor environment: they are usually placed under mount of terrains and inside enclosed buildings. 
		- light mesh: light can be animated and exported via a mesh object
		- LOD of objects is saved in the same x file. Skin LOD and bone LOD can be specified separately. Appears that bone LOD can greatly increase performance than skin LOD. 
		- road rendering: line segments for edition, and one directional map with triangles that mix with the terrain, the borders are alpha blended. 
		- gizmo picking: the gizmo is drawn withouting scaling. and its picking is very simple, appears to be circles around the corners of the 3 planes and arrows. 
		- early z cull is enabled for avoiding pixel shader
		- for shore line: we can render to the depth buffer and use the depth buffer to generate the shoreline. This allows for shoreline alpha blending with not only terrain, but also static shadow casting objects. 
		- ocean: Different LODs had different index buffers but they all referenced to one vertex buffer that had the FFT data.
	- ParaWorld Editor: 
		- login screen text: ParaWorld Editor
		- customizing initial world. Initial world default to worlds/Official/ParaWorldEditor
		- MainbarIcons: Creator, ModelBrowser, create new world, personal world browser, object Browser, ArtTools, terrain editor, Movie, MCML Browser, Submit Bug.
		- create ParaWorldEditor.bat. write the art pipeline for the above process.
		
2008.2.2
	- TODO: we are planning to leverage kids movie creator using the paraworld platform. A separate planet editor will be released under the name of ParaEngine Kids Edition (KidsMovie2). 
		It will compensate the lack of UGC in the early pala5.com product line. It is in fact the world editor used by our artists for creating various planets, yet with all rules removed. 

2008.1.30
	- TerraGenPage.html is implemented for heightfield generation and application. 
	- ide/SaveFileDialog.lua is implemented. 
	- ParaDataProvider now supports: ExecSQL. world_db now updates world attributes by batching transaction using ExecSQL("BEGIN") and ExecSQL("END")
	- ParaTerrain.MergeHeightField(), ParaTerrain.SetHole, ParaTerrain.IsHole, and ParaTerrain.UpdateHoles() is added. 
	- "Ramp", "SetHole" and "MergeHeightField" is operation is added to environment message processor. Terrain holes can now be created via the TerraFormPage.
	
2008.1.29
	- ParaTerrain.Flatten() and ParaTerrain.Spherical() is implemented
	- TerraFormPage is fully implemented with various terrain filters. 
	- AttributeBind property is supported by pe:treenode, we can now bind a pe:treenode to a ParaAttributeObject with selected fields.
		e.g. see TerraPropertyPage.html

2008.1.28
	- TerraPaintPage is fully implemented with drag paint operations and detail texture replace and remove. 
	
2008.1.27
	- pe:sliderbar and ide sliderbar now supports textbox editor. 
	- TerraForm and TerraPaint pages are added to environment app. 
	
2008.1.26
	- terrain paint will now normalize all texture layer masks. 
	
2008.1.22
	- paraworld.email is implemented and tested. 
	- dev schedule is being made company wide

2008.1.21
	- ParaEngine.GetAttributeObject():SetField("EnableProfiling", true) is implemented, which will generate the perf.txt file at the working directory. 
	- fixed on some computer, the getserverlist gives me ClientVersion=1.00100004673, where trailing numbers are meaningless. This is due to TinyJson implementation of double type variables. 
	- fixed: character command point will now stop sliding along wall if the sliding wall speed is too small. 
	
2008.1.20
	- BUG: IME sometimes crashes when switching input method or typing too fast. Currently, the IME uses windows message while the editbox uses hardware device. this sometimes
		leads to input errors when the keys belonging to IME is processed by the hardware.
	- QueryPerformanceCount() leap forward bug is corrected in DXUtil_Timer. this fixed a bug of display error in hardware defects. see: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/274323
	- Fix: Sometimes the graphics suddenly becomes super slow when switching from full screen to windowed mode. This also occurs when the window loses focus for some extend time and then switch back. 
		it is related to the timer function that I use. It is now fixed by using the improved version of DXUtil_Timer

2008.1.18
	- character.db is read locked when opened in the game engine. This will preserve sqlite page cache for all following sql queries. 
	- CCS texture is generated using raw GPU instead of CPU. The default body texture size is reduced to 256 from 512. 

2008.1.17
	- NPL.AppendURLRequest() now support "request_timeout" field, which allows the caller to specify the request timeout time. The default value is rather small as 15000 milliseconds. For file upload and image download, we usually needs to give it a bigger value. 
	- script/ide/timer.lua is added
	- localserver now uses lazy writing, which improves database write performance by over 100x. Please see localserver/readme.txt. the implementation is in WbeCacheDB_def.lua.
	- container scrollbar now supports all animation properties with respect to its container. 
	- sqlite is upgraded from 3.3 to 3.6, which is a major upgrade and support shared db cache. NOTE: sqlite will be default clear cache for each db transaction. 
		sqlite is now a single embedded file in ParaEngine; the old style sqlite3 project is obsoleted.

2008.1.15
	- Chat will reconnect, automatically. 
	
2008.1.14
	- servers moved to IDC center. 
	
2008.1.12
	- increased dynamic buffer size and make it multiple of 3. this fixes a bug when too many triangles are in a single draw pass. 
	- NPL jabber client recv function will now use a buffer of 1024000, so that if we call recv 30 times a second(our current script frame rate). we can have a maximum rate of 30MB/s. This fix  a bug that the client can only process at 30KB/s, when the buffer size is set very small.
	- TeleportPage is refactored. 
	
2008.1.11
	- character facing and animation are supported in JGSL. 
	- JGSL now support recover field in case some agent is intact. 

2008.1.10
	- NPL_NET_REV performance timer is added: it is the total time to receive net messages, especially the jabber and libcurl. 
		If the same client is emulating many concourrent jabber connections, this could grow to 0.05s for 50 connections, because our rev block time is set to 10 microseconds per connection(actually 100 microseconds, since it is the smallest inverval CPU can recognize). 
    - NPL_NET_PRC performance timer is added: this is the net time for processing all the npl.activation stuffs. In case, we handle lots of jabber messages, this is where messages get processed. but it only takes 0.001s, for a gateway server with 50 concurrent users.
    - System.options.ForceGateway is added to force using a gateway server for testing purposes. 
    - from the NPL_NET_REV and NPL_NET_PRC performance: we are sure that it is the ejabberd server that are delaying all the packets. 
    
2008.1.9
	- CGUIToolTip is refactored. and CGUIToolTip_background property is added to config.lua. 
	- NPL.ChangeTimer() bug is fixed. It now behaves as expected. 
	
2008.1.8
	- OpenFileDialog will automatically switch to windowed mode when called in full screen mode.
	- multi-sampling could crash the application if not set properly, we need to switch to a safe graphics mode or a previously correct graphics mode in such conditions. 
		SOLUTION: we will save new config settings to config/config.new.txt if new config contains error prone settings, such as screen resolution and multisample type. 
		at start up, we will delete the config/config.new.txt, file immediately after loading it. It is the game application's task to check for whether we have changed settings and ask the user to save to config.txt.
	- the canvas3d source code is modified, so that active rendering and miniscenegraph name must be explicitly specified. 	
		
2008.1.7
	- GetMCML and GetInfo web service call will only return once regardless whether local version is expired or not. Currently, expired version is only returned when network is not available. 
		Only one exception is that if appkey in GetMCML is nil, expired version is not returned. This is because the local server does not know for which appkey to fetch the result for.
	- when walking to a given direction. facing is not applied. 	

2008.1.6
	- libcurl in ParaEngine now supports manual time out, which is 15 seconds by default. This work around a windows vista issue where DNS resolving time out is not received. 
	- Movement style for bipeds are implemented. ParaObject:GetAttributeObject():SetField("MovementStyle", 4). 
		now that OPC movement has no physics applied. 
	- TODO: if client find an unknown avatar in ping list, it can make request to server to query pinged objects. 
	
2008.1.4
	- portals and zones can now be exported as filename.x.meta file in ParaXExporter. 

2008.1.1
	- TODO: when there are more than JGSL_grid.max_users on a single server, and when we leaves a such a grid node and reconnect again. the client will lose its information. 
	- epolling style server proxy for client communicating with REST server is implemented. it is used for GetBBS with the lobby server. examples in BBSChatWnd
	- TODO: JGSL is connected, but can not be authenticated. 

2008.12.31
	- only relative to grid position is sent during JGSL. this makes the data send smaller than sending absolute position.

2008.12.30
	- both JGSL server and client now send only changed data via server time id(st) and client time id (ct). st and ct are exchanged on both client and server with each message. 
	- TODO: bone billboard in 3dsmax, requires that the bone must be created at the parent pivot location. otherwise the pivot point will be wrong. 
	- we can now limit thet number of character triangles to draw by ParaScene.GetAttributeObject():SetField("MaxCharTriangles", 30000);
	- we can turn on/off menu by ParaEngine.GetAttributeObject():SetField("ShowMenu", false);
	
2008.12.29
	- JGSL streams are encoded with opcode

2008.12.28
	- I accidentally have crash during gethostbyname in libcurl, as described here http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2007-01/0067.html and http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2007-03/0206.html
		solutions is here http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2007-03/0217.html
		To switch to synchronous DNS resolver. see hostip.c. and we need to undefine  CURLRES_THREADED and define CURLRES_SYNCH
	- curl_multi_setopt can be used to configure how the multi interface behave. this is very useful, such as CURLMOPT_PIPELINING and CURLMOPT_MAXCONNECTS
		when using multi interface, it appears that DNS cache and connection cache are automatically shared by default. and one can even pipeline connections. 
	- c-ares is added to ParaEngine in order to support multithreaded libcurl. inet_ntop.* is renamed to inet_ntop_cres.* since the name conflicts with file under libcurl.
		USE_ARES is defined in the preprocessor so that libcurl knows that c-ares is compiled. adig.c ahost.c and acountry should be removed from source file. 
	- table.resize() is added to NPL. 
	- ValueTracker.lua is added to JGSL.	
	- onmouseleave event in ParaUIObject is not called when the mouse leaves one of its child controls. the old behavior is reversed. 
	- offline authentication mode is added to paraworld.auth.AuthUser(). msg.HasOfflineMode denotes whether offline mode is supported. 
		we can support it if user has at least successfully logged in once. The caller of paraworld.auth.AuthUser can suppress offline mode by simply display the msg.info. 
		Offline mode dialog is shown if the caller does not supress offline mode like above. 
	- ide/stringmap.lua is implemented for bidirection map. see example in JGSL_stringmap.lua	
		
2008.12.27
	- EmuUsers now support autoreply text. 
	- ParaGlobal.random() function is fixed by providing our own my_rand function.
	- URLResourceStore:GetURL() default behavior changes to: if fetching failed, we will return the local server version (even if it is expired). 
		if there is no local server version either, the error HTTP msg is returned. However, there is bUseExpire params, if one wants to return the expired version immediately before fetching the updated version. 

2008.12.25
	- minimap.xml is implemented in minimapwnd. we can put minimap.xml to the world root directory.
	- JGSL is refactored to support multiple gateway and multiple gridnodes architecture. See JGSL_doc.txt

2008.12.22
	- Ocean technique is now persistent during world saving. We support the old slow water rendering with reflection and ocean height. and we support a new faster ocean shader called ocean_water_high.fx.
		One can change the ocean rendering tech via the OceanPage.html. 
	- The old ocean FFT	now uses a single bump texture
	- ParaScene.GetObject(myParaObject:GetID()) is supported. GetID returns the ID of the object. The ID of the object is only generated when the first time this function is called. 
		One can then easily get the object, by calling ParaScene.GetObject. When an object is released, its ID is not longer used. Please note that the ID is neither unique outside the world, nor persistent in the same world.

2008.12.21
	- msg.jckey is added to all jabber messages. ALL jabber messages now contains jckey, which allows you to distinguish which JC instance received the message. 
		One can use local jc = JabberClientManager.CreateJabberClient(msg.jckey); to get the instance if there are more than one possible client. 
	
2008.12.20
	- HTTP/FTP status code is returned in msg.rcode during URL request. This saves us time to manually check msg.header for status code. 
	
2008.12.19
	- ocean bump texture is not inited until used. TODO: find a better way to render ripple on terrain. 
	- ParaAsset.SetAssetServerUrl() is implemented. if an asset is not found, we will fetch it via the provided asset server. 
	- static textures and static model without LOD can now be loaded from remote server if any.

2008.12.18
	- HTTP texture cache is set to "temp/cache/"
	- miniscenegraph:SaveToFile() will save dds with DXT3 by default.
	- ccs compositive texture is saved to "temp/composeskin/". the file name is hashed according to the different layer names. 
		This makes loading CCS character faster on subsequent runs. CCS based NPC characters never change appearance, so they are most likely to share the same appearance and compositive texture files. 
		TODO: ccs face compositive texture may be treated the same way. 
	- ParaGlobal.OpenFileDialog is implemented. 
	
2008.12.17
	- Customizable character model now fully support .xml LOD. Usually lowest LOD is used for shadow map pass. 

2008.12.16
	- localserver will now automatically detect current version and upgrade itself if needed. This is done by creating a Database/localserver.ver file besides the local server db file. 
	- All paraworld services are converted to REST with local server support. 
	- NPL.FromJson is added, which uses tinyJson to parse json string to NPL table. 
	
2008.12.14
	- CUrlUtility and CUrlBuilder class implemented in ParaEngine. 
	- script/ide/Json.lua is implemented for encoding and decoding json with lua table. 
	- JsonRest web service wrapper implemented. 
	- NPL.AppendURLRequest now supports both HTTP post, HTTP post file, and HTTP get with NPL table parameter passing. See TestCurl.lua. 

2008.12.13
	- NPL.AppendURLRequest is fully implemented with the curllib interface. It will now handle connection pools with limited worker slots. Both file and http get/post are supported. 
	- I haved included libcUrl source statically to ParaEngine. I used to have it as dynamic dll, however, it causes crashes in the debug build. This may be a visual studio bug. so I just included all sources in the core engine. 
		Visual Studio 2008 has a bug of ignoring compiling files with the same file name in different directories. So i have to change base64.c and md5.c to curl_base64.c, and curl_md5.c, since there are already such files in the solution. 
		More over: CURL_STATICLIB needs to be added to preprocessor, Wldap32.lib should be added to the link. 
	- URLResourceStore is supported by localserver with full rest support.	

2008.12.9
	- NPL text and code encoding is changed from system default to UTF8. This is a major change, especially for file related strings. 
		Use "script/ide/Encoding.lua" whenever you want to display any file related strings, or use GUI strings as input to file IOs. 
		In the future, we must be aware of the NPL file encoding, MCML encoding, GUI encoding, jabber message, REST API, and all system IO string encodings. 
		UTF8 is the recommented choice for NPL file, MCML file, GUI, Jabber and REST. however, all strings used by system calls like IO functions are only supported in native system encoding. 
		For an example, please see FileExplorerCtrl.lua and PersonalWorldPage.lua. PersonalWorldPage.lua demostrates conversion between IO, MCML, and GUI. 
		Rule:  whenever you get a string in the GUI, and want to use it as input to file IO functions, you need to convert it from UTF8 to default encoding; whenever you want to display a filename via a GUI object, you need to convert it from default encoding to UTF8. 
	- It is highly recommended that all model asset files and world files use only standard english words. 
	- Visual studio and VSS(source control server) both recognize file encoding when checking in/out files. They will automatically omit BOM (such as utf8 signature when comparing files). Ultraedit also use some magic code to decide the best encoding by examing a large segment of code if BOM is not at the beginning of the file. 
	- NPL.load is able to load source files with or without UFT8 signature. However, the visual studio NPL compiler will fail if there is a BOM (0xEFBBBF) at the beginning of the file. 
		So it is highly recommended that one saves lua file as UTF8 without signature. If you are not sure about which encoding to use, just never include localized strings in source files( just read those strings from other places (such as text or db files) whose encoding you know).
	- currently all world files and model assets path strings use system default encoding, this makes saving and reading on the native computer easier. And it is generally not a problem to copy and paste files from one machine to another. 
		However, if the default encoding on the other machine is different from the development machine's, it will display bizzar characters, but data itself should be fine. So if one wants to display strings based on file name, make sure they are explicitly saved with a known encoding (such as UTF8), other than the default. 
	
2008.12.7
	- CNplWriter class is implemented for ease of generating npl table code in jabber event handler. 
	- npl jabber interface now support registration
	- npl jabber event binding is improved
	
2008.12.6
	- F6 key will trigger the unit test console. 
	- TODO: who is going to oversee the servers when released during spring festival. 

2008.12.5
	- ParaUIObject.ApplyAnim() is added. This is usually used on container objects to apply its animation to all its children using the reference point of current object. More info, see TestGUI.lua. 
	
2008.12.4
	- camera facing and billboarding is supported for static and animated models, with material and bones, respectively. 
	- ParaUIObject.colormask attribute added. It is usually used to alpha fade a control. 
      
2008.12.2
	- addictive alpha blending model is added for parax exporter for both static and animated models.
	- MaxScript is added to script/MaxScript/Start_ParaEditor.ms
	- reflection surface height will now derive the height from the first triangle in the material. 
	- reflection material is supported in lightmapped models. 
	- commonlib.multi_inherit is implemented in NPL. 
	- NPL.GetURL("www.paraengine.com") is implemented. 

2008.12.1
	- guicontainer's onactivate event is added to NPL, which allows us to receive activate and deactivate events when a top level container changes focus. see TestEvent.lua.
	- 3dsmax exporter for paraengine is upgraded to vs 2008. A few 3dsmax 8 sdk include files are changed according to new c++ compiler. 
	- Bug fixed: static mesh object will not load any unused materials. This fixed a bug when the material id is not the same as the mesh attribute id. 

2008.11.30
	- we prevent camera movement if either ctrl, alt, shift key is pressed.
	- key up event is added to 3d scene. please note that key up event is fired to 3d scene key up handler even the GUI has focus. In other words, there are more up events than down event. 
	- ParaUI.IsKeyPressed(DIK_SCANCODE.DIK_LCONTROL) is implemented. more info, please see event_mapping.lua
	- ParaScene.GetObjectsByScreenRect is implemented. see TestPicking.lua
	
2008.11.29
	- All NPL jabber function implementations can now be compiled to use either c++ (gloox,curl) or .Net. There is however, a performance boost for c++ version. 
		we will now completely get rid of .net dependency on release mode. 
	- zlib is now moved to a dynamic dll
	- gloox (c++ jabber client) is added as part of ParaEngine instead of a dynamic dll. dynamic dll is fine at release time, however, it generates warnings at debug time. So I decide to include gloox as part of paraengine core.

2008.11.25
	- NPL now supports curl. see "script/test/TestCurl.lua"
	- simulated sky is now persistent on world db.
	
2008.11.24
	- libcURL is compiled and added to ParaWorld. I build curl as a dynamic dll with multithreaded c lib, and copy dll from curl/lib/release to root directory.
	- raw lua-cUrl is added to NPL. We can now call cUrl via NPL.
	- paraworld solution is ported from vs 2005 to vs 2008. 
	- the f-in-box dll is now updated to become vs 2008 compatible. version is 3_3_1
	- Compiled FCollada in vs2008. i commented the lines: in libxml/config.h and libxml/win32config.h otherwise i was having a lot of errors regarding vsnprintf and snprintf). and added #define snprintf _snprintf

2008.11.22
	- TextSprite is added to IDE. script/ide/TextSprite.lua. It can be used to render large numbers. 
	
2008.11.21
	- MouseButtons can now be disabled via camera attribute. 
	- Simulated sky is implemented in ParaEngine. See EnvPage.html for more information.

2008.11.6
	- HelloChat now supports loading world from external command. 
	- pe:canvas3d now supports objectbinding attribute.  see AssetInfoViewer.html for example. model asset viewer layout (AssetInfoViewer.html) is implemented in HelloChat app. 
	- HelloChat Animation Skill command is added for demo purposes. "Profile.HelloChat.DoSkill"
	- Load Movie Immediately from external command
	- TODO: World registration is enabled. 
	- TODO: a task dialog created for demo purposes. 
	- TODO: The chat window displays. 
	
2008.11.5
	- pe:bag drag and drop operation implemented. 
	- pe:bag supports inner node command. The HelloChat demos the use of pe:bag for all its asset types. It can add selection to bag, and it can drag an asset to outside to delete it. 
	- the movie app demo is done by leio. pretty cool.
	
2008.11.4
	- pe:bag mcml page is implemented.

	- to prevent dll hell, all libs are using multithreaded c run time, instead of multithreaded dll.
	- About building directX show libs. DirectX Show is now part of the windows platform SDK. however, I still build  it from the dxsdk_feb2005_extras, the steps are below
		- download and install to Root/dxsdk_feb2005_extras/DirectShow/Include, add to additional project include path
		- go to and build dxsdk_feb2005_extras\DirectShow\Samples\C++\DirectShow\BaseClasses and copy debug and release output to Root\lib_release\lib\strmbasd.lib and STRMBASE.lib. 
		- (During build, needs to correct several bugs to the source code and change to multithreaded mode,since they are not compatible with the new compiler)
	  Note: the above project and files are	stored in vss as well. One can grab all files from vss.
	- TODO: FCollada is added to solution. I intend to support collada file format for static models.

		I uninstalled, started and killed process many times, and it wonnot work. After installing a asus AI software and have the E drive disk checked (actually skipped on reboot), the vs 2005 can restart again. but the message
		The Windows Forms Designer Hosting Package ({68939055-38E0-4D17-92CB-8909710D8178}) did not load because of previous errors. For assistance, contact the package vendor. To attempt to load this package again, type 'devenv /resetskippkgs' at the command prompt.
		appears on each subsequent reboot. and it asks me to run "devenv.exe" /resetskippkgs next times. There are some google results of failed loading packages on vs. however, I also suspect that it is the disk problem. 
	- for highlighting lua source code, there are two ways without using additional software, like lualangpak. 
		One is provided by VS itself. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa301710.aspx
		the other is by visual assist X, because VB code looks a lot like lua, except the comment.

	- portal rendering algrithm itself is fully implemented. there are some limitations to the current portal system
		- only the outer world zone can contain other zones
		- the camera can see into a room via at most one portal. in other words, there can not be two doors in to the same room with positive dot product. 
			if there have two such doors, one of the door contents are ignored which renders the result undefined. 
		- mobile characters will be automatically added to appropriate zones. However, it is advised to use simple zone shapes with just a few planes	
		- static mesh objects are manually added to zones at scene saving time or model exporting time
		- objects inside a zone will not be shadow casters.
		- zones consists of planes, which are expressed as normal from the origin(0,0,0), hence the zone must be convex and contain the origin 0,0,0 point in its inner space. if the zone node contains a exact point (0,0,0) it will automatically become the ground plane. 
	- portal system will automatically disable sky, ocean, shadow, and terrain when camera is in a zone disconnected with the outer world. 
	- BUG: the mainmenu in script will black out once when first show up.

2008/3/27
	- I found that the xmlserializer strips away \r\n out during deserialization (and just leave \n). WebService strips out \r\n (an leave \n) even using XMLNode.SetInnerText(). 
	  so the msg code sending using InnerText of XML web service call will have \r removed. This leads to errors for scode. 
	  A workaround is to replace \r and \n with &#x000d; and &#x000a; respectively in FillDataToXmlElement of NPLParser.cs and SerializeToScode in message converter for string type. In fact, I just replace \r, since \n is not removed unless it is for xml attribute. 
	  NOTE: I do not know if there are other hidden rules for ANSI code page by MS web service. but currently, I only find \r is an undocumented exception. 
	- SetValue and GetValue is implemented for each mcml control base class. This allows databinding with MCML node at page load time or later with page region update. 
		So far, MCML databinding is bidirectional. Please see script/kids/3DMapSystemApp/profiles/ProfileRegPage.lua for an example of two-way databinding. The above page class uses databinding to display existing user profile as well as collecting user input

2008/3/24

	- Default HTTP texture in ParaEngine now uses local server resource store as well. see ParaAsset.GetRemoteTexture(url) in script/ide/ParaEngineExtension.lua
		- because of the delayed loading. GUI's texture dimension is not updated when texture is updated. ParaEngine now deals with http textures by retrieving its size each time they are used. 
		  There is some tricky code to set size to (-1,-1) and use whitedot.png when texture is being downloaded.
