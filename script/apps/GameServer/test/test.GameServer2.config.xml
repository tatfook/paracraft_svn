  @param compress_incoming: whether to use compression for incoming connections. 
    This must be true in order for CompressionLevel and CompressionThreshold to take effect 
  @param CompressionLevel: -1, 0-9: Set the zlib compression level to use in case compresssion is enabled. 
    Compression level is an integer in the range of -1 to 9. 
		Lower compression levels result in faster execution, but less compression. Higher levels result in greater compression, 
		but slower execution. The zlib constant -1, provides a good compromise between compression and speed and is equivalent to level 6. 
  @param CompressionThreshold:  when the message size is bigger than this number of bytes, we will use m_nCompressionLevel for compression. 
		For message smaller than the threshold, we will not compress even m_nCompressionLevel is not 0.
