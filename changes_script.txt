	-  TODO: purchase https://www.wosign.com/Products/WoSign_CodeSigning.htm  for ParaEngine and resign the haqi2 cab 

TODO:
   * TreeView remember scroll pos is not perfect because of the rendering algorithm. the logical bottom value may be calculated twice with different results. 

Done: AutoUpdater should be updated to support multiple process download. 
Haqi should support multiple user login perfectly
On start up AutoUpdater should support verifying md5 of all files. 
Firebreath should be updated to latest version and to svn as well.
Haqi should support switching servers dynamically without causing any problems. There should a handy interface for switching servers(no need to switch users)
haqi should support teleporting to a non-stranger(team member or friend) (the friend chat ui should replace go to homeland button with go to user button). 
Taurus should support saving world without any problems.
GM tools requirement.
Game preload to avoid raw and script file synchrounous loading. 



DBServer refactor avoid using multiple thread (a single one is enough), instead of query sql, query NPL directly,so that per user info is not needed. Only flush every 5 minutes. 
Designing DB server and maintaining scripts so that server can run all day, every day. 

Pondering game design: a robot contest, a movie contest, a world creation contest.  

Sending invitation for a new programmer guy. 
Prepare new seats for new members. 
Prepare computer for clayman
   The first task for clayman is to refactor the ocean rendering for low end computers with C++. Using only shader 1.0. 
   The second task for clayman is to extract all wow models and animations from WOW in max format and compatible to ParaX format. 
   The third task for clayman is to abstract the rendering api so that it can work.

Create a tool so that designers can dynamically add new homeland creation items in shop and stores, and also in local dream world. 

The login page can use full 3d display: use real 3d scene and scene picking as the background, so that it is resolution independent. 
DEADLINE 2.24: The login interface should support verification image
DEADLINE 2.24: Support account registration interface within the game.  Try to bridge with Kuaiwan. 
IExplorer should be opened from the game engine on any machine. 

If a mob will drop a given item with a fixed probability, then we will inform the user that he or she does not get the item by chance. w101 does a better job on this. 
A simple script that ping the DBServer and verify that all servers are working as expected. We may need to prepare many nid for this. 

ParaX Exporter should not merge vertex if there normals differs a lot. 

2010.2.9
	- Created a anim exporter tool for leyee.com

2010.12.3
	- EnvironmentPresets added to PETOOLS 

2010.9.16
	- pe_stackview implemented. see pe_stackview and test_pe_stackview.html for examples

2010.9.15
	- Aries web redist now uses bat file instead of pure short cut with command line. this will prevent 360 from reporting potential virus

2010.9.13
	- hierachical databinding for pe:treeview implemented
	
2010.9.12
	- WorldManager is added to implement multiple game world and settings . See script/apps/Aries/Scene/WorldManager.lua
	  A lot of related files like HomeLandGateway, LocalMap, Scene/main, etc are modified (or cleaned up). It is not totally clean yet. 
	  The new config file is here. "config/Aries/Scene/AriesGameWorlds.config.xml"
	  TODO: There is still some special case in LocalMap and some old wish quests that teleporting may not work. 

2010.9.10
	- web redist support plugin install while plugin is being used. the new plugin will take effect when IE restart

2010.7.21
	we need to arrange some time to optimize the combat system. 
	The arena timer function is already optimized. 
	now there are several other places in OnArenaNormalUpdate_by_key_value. 
	- For each arena of OnArenaNormalUpdate_by_key_value in all arenas
	   - 1. CreateArenaObj: only create once and use visibility. make unused characters invisible to pass render in C++.
	   - 2. For each mob only create once, and move hp, headon text, etc to OnFramemove of the mob. 
			So we can REMOVE all mobs iteraction code, except the first time for creation. 
	   - 3. For each player in arena, move all code to OPC frame move. and REMOVE all OPC iteration code. 
			No need to (Un)MountPlayerOnSlot except for the self player, let the GSL to do the jobs for OPCs every 3 seconds. 
	If we do above, there will be zero C++ API calls unless some mobs or OPC is in view range. 

2010.7.13
	- echo is commonlib.echo
	- runtime errors within MCML page will show which file and line
	- echo and applog now print on a single line and uses the more optimized C++ API for serialization

2010.5.31
	- [LiXizhi] every developer can co-edit this file. 
	
2010.5.30
	- script vss solution is now moved to svn, using a mixture of lock and merge mode on its files. 
	- script solution is upgraded from vs 2008 to vs 2010.
